Just as a disclaimer, all of the "gameFiles" directory was made by following a tutorial by Brackeys on youtube. The reason why is because we didn't have the time to create the game for our own project, and therefor we wanted to put in a placeholder for the game we actually wanted to make. This project was moreso a prototype show that we could make an App give you access to the game's content through making assignments, so I hope people don't see this as malicous, as we have made the whole app interface ourselves. Here is a link to the video and the assetpack we folowed/used:
